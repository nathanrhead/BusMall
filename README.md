### Questions that occurred to me during the build

* Render function: I don't understand how the parameter "imageElement" ties "imageElement.src = allProducts[randomIndex].filepath;" and "imageElement.alt = allProducts[randomIndex].name;" to the invoked function render with agrument of imageOneElment, imageTwoElement, and imageThreeElement. 

* Also, why don't imageElement.alt and imageElement.src need variables? What are they called when they're just part of a function without being a variable?
